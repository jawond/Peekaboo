# Peekaboo Repository Reorganization Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully reorganized the Peekaboo repository for better structure and maintainability.

### What Changed

1. **Created logical top-level directories:**
   - `Core/` - Shared libraries (PeekabooCore, AXorcist)
   - `Apps/` - Applications (Mac, CLI)
   - `Server/` - TypeScript MCP server
   - `Scripts/` - Build and utility scripts
   - `Docs/` - Documentation
   - `Archive/` - Deprecated projects

2. **Flattened Mac app structure:**
   - Removed double nesting (`PeekabooMac/Peekaboo/Peekaboo/` → `Apps/Mac/Peekaboo/`)
   - Cleaner, more intuitive path

3. **Standardized naming:**
   - `peekaboo-cli` → `Apps/CLI`
   - Consistent capitalization

4. **Grouped server files:**
   - All TypeScript/Node.js files now in `Server/`
   - Easier to manage server-specific dependencies

5. **Updated all references:**
   - Fixed Package.swift paths
   - Updated package.json scripts
   - Modified build scripts
   - Updated .gitignore

### Verification

✅ CLI builds successfully: `cd Apps/CLI && swift build`
✅ Mac app builds successfully: `cd Apps/Mac && swift build`
✅ All dependencies resolve correctly
✅ Inspector integrated into Mac app (no longer standalone)

### Benefits
