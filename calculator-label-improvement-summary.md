# Calculator Label Improvement Summary

## Problem
The Calculator app buttons weren't exposing their numeric labels through the standard accessibility properties that Peekaboo was checking. All buttons appeared as generic "AXButton" elements without meaningful labels, making it impossible for the AI agent to identify which button was "7", "8", etc.

## Root Cause
The Xcode Accessibility Inspector showed that Calculator buttons have a separate "Label" property (e.g., "Label: 7") that wasn't being captured by our existing implementation. We were only checking:
- title (null for Calculator buttons)  
- description (null)
- help (null)
- roleDescription (null)

## Solution
1. **Added AXLabel attribute extraction** in SessionCache.swift:
   ```swift
   // Try to get the AXLabel attribute directly (common for buttons with numeric/text labels)
   let axLabel = element.attribute(Attribute<String>("AXLabel"))
   
   // Use the actual label if available, otherwise fall back to other descriptive properties
   let label = axLabel ?? description ?? help ?? roleDescription ?? title ?? value
   ```

2. **Enhanced JSON output** to include label and identifier fields:
   ```swift
   struct UIElementSummary: Codable {
       let id: String
       let role: String
       let title: String?
       let label: String?      // NEW
       let identifier: String? // NEW
       let is_actionable: Bool
       let keyboard_shortcut: String?
   }
   ```

## Results
Now Calculator buttons properly expose their labels:
- Button "7" → `{id: "Calculator_B8", label: "7", identifier: "Seven"}`
- Button "8" → `{id: "Calculator_B9", label: "8", identifier: "Eight"}`
- Button "9" → `{id: "Calculator_B10", label: "9", identifier: "Nine"}`
- And so on...

## Agent Performance
With proper labels, the agent can now:
- ✅ Identify specific number buttons (0-9)
- ✅ Click on the correct buttons for calculations
- ✅ Successfully perform complex calculations like "123 + 456"
- ✅ Distinguish between operation buttons (Add, Multiply, etc.) and number buttons

## Example Usage
```bash
# The agent can now properly calculate using button clicks
./peekaboo agent "Calculate 42 + 58" --model gpt-4o

# Result: Successfully clicks 4, 2, +, 5, 8, = and returns 100
```

## Technical Details
- The "AXLabel" attribute is a standard macOS accessibility attribute
- It's commonly used for UI elements that display text/numbers
- This fix will benefit any macOS app that uses AXLabel for button identification
- The identifier field provides additional context (e.g., "Seven" for button "7")

This improvement makes Peekaboo's agent significantly more capable when interacting with Calculator and similar apps that rely on AXLabel for element identification.
