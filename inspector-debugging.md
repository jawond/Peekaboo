# PeekabooInspector Debugging Notes

## Issues Identified and Fixes Applied

### 1. Memory Management Crash
**Problem**: Application was crashing with EXC_BAD_ACCESS in objc_release
**Root Cause**: Retaining AXElement references in UIElement struct was causing memory management issues
**Fix**: Removed `axElement` property from UIElement struct to avoid retention issues

### 2. Coordinate Transformation Issues
**Problem**: Overlay elements were bunched in corner or positioned incorrectly
**Root Cause**: Double transformation of coordinates - both window creation and element positioning were applying Y-axis flips
**Fixes Applied**:
- Changed overlay windows to full-screen to simplify coordinate system
- Updated `flipYCoordinate` function to properly convert from Accessibility API (top-left origin) to SwiftUI (bottom-left origin)
- Use primary screen height for consistent coordinate transformation

### 3. Performance Issues
**Problem**: Inspector was locking up for long periods
**Fixes Applied**:
- Reduced refresh rate from 2s to 5s
- Limited element processing to 200 elements per app
- Only process elements with valid frames

### 4. Overlay Window Management
**Changes Made**:
- Create one overlay window per application
- Use `.floating + 1` window level (above normal floating windows but below screen saver)
- Full-screen overlay windows to avoid coordinate complexity

## Current Status

### What's Working
- Application runs without crashing after removing AXElement retention
- Overlay toggle can be enabled/disabled
- Application detection works (shows 17 apps)
- UI interaction is possible when overlays are disabled

### What's Not Working
1. **Overlay Visibility**: Application overlays not showing
   - Test overlay (red square) appears successfully, proving window creation works
   - Issue is specific to application overlay creation or element processing
   - Previously saw chaotic overlays, now none are showing for actual apps
2. **Dropdown Menu**: Menu button clicks but dropdown doesn't open
   - Found correct element (AXMenuButton at 745, 146)
   - Click registers but menu doesn't appear
3. **App Crash Dialog**: There's an App Crash window showing that needs investigation

## Click Coordinate Issue
When trying to click "All Applications" dropdown at coordinates (540, 228), I was actually clicking on TextEdit in the background instead of the PeekabooInspector window. This suggests:
- The coordinates I'm using are screen coordinates, not window-relative
- Need to be more careful about which window is being targeted

**Update**: Found the correct menu button element:
- Element ID: `Peekaboo_Inspec_G7`
- Role: `AXMenuButton`
- Title: "All Applications"
- Coordinates: (745.5, 146) with size (130.5, 16)
- Successfully clicked at (745, 146) but dropdown didn't open - might be a UI state issue

## Root Cause Analysis

### Inspector Crash Issue
The inspector crashed when I added:
1. `await MainActor.run` block in refreshAllApplications - likely caused threading issues
2. Test overlay creation - might have conflicted with existing window management

Both changes were reverted and the crash was resolved.

### Overlay Not Showing Issue
The main issue is that `refreshAllApplications()` runs asynchronously in a Task, but `createOverlayWindows()` is called inside that async task. When the overlay toggle is clicked:
1. `toggleOverlay()` is called
2. `refreshAllApplications()` is called, which starts an async Task
3. The function returns immediately
4. The async task eventually completes and calls `createOverlayWindows()`
5. But by this time, the UI state might have changed

This timing issue explains why overlays sometimes appeared chaotic (old data) and sometimes don't appear at all.

## Next Steps
1. Fix the async timing issue in overlay creation
2. Ensure overlay windows are created on the main thread
3. Fix coordinate system for overlay positioning
4. Test with TextEdit only mode once overlays are working
5. Verify overlay elements align correctly with actual UI elements

## Testing Approach
The user suggested testing with just TextEdit to simplify debugging:
- Enable TextEdit-only mode via dropdown
- Capture screenshots to verify overlay positioning
- Check if overlays align with TextEdit UI elements
- Fix any coordinate transformation issues

## Summary of Debug Session

### Key Findings
1. **Window Creation Works**: Test overlay (red square) appeared successfully, proving NSWindow creation works
2. **Async Timing Issue**: Overlay windows are created in an async Task, causing timing issues
3. **Threading Issues**: Using `await MainActor.run` caused crashes
4. **No Overlays Showing**: Despite elements being detected (1,134 elements), overlay windows aren't appearing

### Attempted Solutions
1. ‚úÖ Fixed memory crash by removing AXElement retention
2. ‚úÖ Created test overlay to verify window creation works
3. ‚úÖ Added DispatchQueue.main.async for UI updates
4. ‚úÖ Added debug print statements
5. ‚ùå Overlays still not appearing for actual applications

### Current State
- Inspector runs without crashing
- Elements are detected (shows count in UI)
- ‚úÖ Overlay windows ARE being created and rendered!
- Debug overlay shows "Overlay for: Ghostty" with "Elements: 20"
- Yellow tint confirms window is full-screen
- Issue was that overlays were transparent - needed debug visuals to see them

### Breakthrough
The overlays were working all along but were completely transparent! By adding:
1. Yellow background to the window
2. Debug text showing app name and element count
3. Purple background to the SwiftUI view

We can now see the overlay is rendering correctly.

## Current Issues (Continuing Debug)

### 1. Over-Release Crash
- **Symptom**: Crash in `objc_release` during `[_NSWindowTransformAnimation dealloc]`
- **Cause**: Window animation causing over-release of objects
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Disabled window animations with `window.animationBehavior = .none`
  - Added `NSAnimationContext` with duration 0 when creating/removing windows
  - Set `contentView = nil` before closing windows

### 2. Coordinate Positioning Wrong
- **Symptom**: Overlay indicators appear offset from actual UI elements
- **Issue**: Complex coordinate system mixing:
  - Accessibility API: Origin at top-left of screen, Y increases downward
  - NSScreen: Origin at bottom-left of screen, Y increases upward  
  - NSWindow: Frame uses NSScreen coordinates (bottom-left origin)
  - SwiftUI in window: Origin at top-left of window, Y increases downward
- **Attempts**:
  1. ‚úÖ Initial Y-flip implementation - overlays appeared but offset
  2. ‚ùå Removed Y-flip thinking coordinates matched - indicators appeared at bottom
  3. ‚úÖ Re-added Y-flip with proper calculation
  4. üîÑ Added debug output to understand actual coordinates
- **Current Status**: Confirmed coordinate systems:
  - Test markers at (0,0) and (100,100) appear correctly
  - SwiftUI in full-screen window uses (0,0) at top-left (matches AX)
  - Element indicators are offset - appearing too far down and right
  - Issue is NOT with coordinate system transformation
  - Issue appears to be with how we're positioning elements or getting their frames

### 3. Too Many Overlays
- **User Feedback**: "a thousand overlays that basically don't see anything anymore"
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Changed from full element overlays to Peekaboo-style corner indicators
  - Only show overlays for actionable elements
  - Small circles with element IDs instead of covering entire elements

## Final Resolution

### The Solution
1. **Window Level**: Changed from `.floating + 1` to `.screenSaver` to ensure overlays appear above all other windows
2. **Coordinate System**: The Y-axis flipping was already correct
3. **Transparency Issue**: Overlays were rendering but were nearly invisible with 0.1 opacity
4. **Debug Process**:
   - Added yellow window background
   - Added debug text showing app name
   - Increased element overlay opacity from 0.1 to 0.3
   - Confirmed overlays appear correctly positioned over UI elements

### Working Features
- ‚úÖ All UI elements are highlighted with colored overlays
- ‚úÖ Different colors for different element types (buttons, text fields, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Overlays update in real-time as applications change
- ‚úÖ Hover detection works (elements become more opaque when hovered)
- ‚úÖ Multiple application overlays work simultaneously

### Lessons Learned
1. Always add visible debug elements when troubleshooting invisible UI
2. Window level is critical for overlay visibility on macOS
3. SwiftUI coordinate transformations work correctly with proper Y-axis flipping
4. Async timing issues can be resolved with DispatchQueue.main.async

## Final Implementation (Latest)

### Problem: Multiple Overlay Windows
When creating one full-screen overlay window per application, only the last window ordered to front was visible. This caused overlays from only one app to show at a time.

### Solution: Single Window for All Apps
1. Created `AllAppsOverlayView` that renders overlays for all applications in a single window
2. Replaced multiple per-app windows with one main overlay window
3. Used proper Swift logging with `Logger` instead of print statements
4. Maintained Peekaboo-style indicators (small circles with element IDs)

### Results
- ‚úÖ All application overlays visible simultaneously
- ‚úÖ Correct positioning of UI element indicators
- ‚úÖ No crashes or memory issues
- ‚úÖ Clean logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Performance optimized by showing only actionable elements

## Memory Management Fix

### Problem: Autorelease Pool Crash
App was crashing with `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` in `objc_release` after ~2 minutes of running with overlays enabled.

### Root Cause
1. Overlay windows were being recreated every 5 seconds on timer
2. Constant creation/destruction of NSWindow objects caused memory management issues
3. Setting `contentView = nil` before closing windows was problematic

### Solution
1. Modified `createOverlayWindows()` to check if window already exists before creating
2. Removed `contentView = nil` - let ARC handle cleanup
3. Properly invalidate timers and remove event monitors
4. Changed logger from static to instance property to avoid capture issues
5. Removed MainActor method calls from deinit

### Result
- App now runs without crashes
- Single overlay window is reused instead of recreated
- Proper memory management throughout the lifecycle

## Console App Sidebar Elements Fix

### Problem
User reported: "I'm looking at the Console app, and I would expect that each element in the sidebar has an annotation, but I don't see any of them annotated."

### Root Cause
The sidebar elements (AXRow, AXCell, AXStaticText, etc.) were not included in the `isActionableRole()` function, so they were filtered out and had no overlay indicators.

### Solution
1. Updated `isActionableRole()` to include sidebar-related roles:
   - AXRow, AXCell, AXStaticText, AXOutline
   - AXList, AXTable, AXGroup

2. Implemented a detail level system to control overlay clutter:
   - **Essential**: Only buttons, links, and inputs
   - **Moderate**: Include rows, cells, lists, tables (default)
   - **All**: Show everything actionable

3. Added UI controls to change detail level dynamically

4. Updated `AllAppsOverlayView` to use the detail level filter

### Result
- Console app sidebar elements now show overlay indicators
- Detail level control prevents UI clutter
- User can adjust detail level based on needs
