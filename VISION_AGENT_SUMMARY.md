# Peekaboo Agent with Vision Capabilities

## Summary

We have successfully implemented vision capabilities for the Peekaboo agent, allowing it to:

1. **See and understand screen content** - The agent can now take screenshots and analyze them using GPT-4o's vision capabilities
2. **Answer questions about what it sees** - The agent can describe applications, windows, UI elements, and content visible on screen
3. **Combine vision with actions** - The agent can use visual understanding to guide its interactions with the UI

## Key Implementation Details

### Vision Analysis Integration

1. **Added `analyze_screenshot` tool** - A new tool that uses the Chat Completions API with vision support
2. **Enhanced `see` command** - Added optional `analyze` parameter to include vision analysis with screenshots
3. **Internal executor** - Created `AgentInternalExecutor.swift` that calls Peekaboo functions directly (though we reverted to external executor due to ArgumentParser issues)

### Technical Approach

Since the OpenAI Assistants API doesn't directly support vision, we implemented a workaround:
- The agent uses function calling to invoke vision analysis
- The `analyze_screenshot` function uses the Chat Completions API with GPT-4o's vision capabilities
- Images are encoded as base64 and sent with the proper message format

### Example Usage

```bash
# Simple vision analysis
./peekaboo agent "Take a screenshot and describe what applications are visible" --model gpt-4o

# Complex task with vision
./peekaboo agent "Launch Safari, wait for it to load, then tell me what's on the webpage" --model gpt-4o

# Interactive UI automation with vision
./peekaboo agent "Open TextEdit, type 'Hello World', then verify the text was typed correctly" --model gpt-4o
```

## Files Modified

1. **AgentInternalExecutor.swift** (NEW) - Internal executor with vision analysis
2. **AgentCommand.swift** - Updated to support vision tools
3. **AgentFunctions.swift** - Added `analyze_screenshot` tool definition
4. **AgentExecutor.swift** - Added support for `analyze_screenshot` command mapping

## Testing Results

The agent successfully:
- ✅ Launches applications
- ✅ Takes screenshots
- ✅ Analyzes screen content using GPT-4o vision
- ✅ Describes UI elements, windows, and content
- ✅ Combines multiple actions with visual verification

## Future Improvements

1. Fix ArgumentParser initialization issues in `AgentInternalExecutor` to avoid shelling out
2. Add more sophisticated vision-guided interactions (e.g., "click on the button that says X")
3. Implement visual verification loops (e.g., "keep clicking until you see Y")
4. Add support for multiple vision providers (Anthropic Claude, local models, etc.)

## Conclusion

The Peekaboo agent now has powerful vision capabilities that enable it to understand and interact with macOS applications in a more human-like way. This opens up possibilities for complex automation tasks that require visual understanding and verification.
