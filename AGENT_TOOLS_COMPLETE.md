## How Tools are Advertised to the Agent

Each tool is advertised with:
1. **Name** - The function name (e.g., "peekaboo_click")
2. **Description** - What the tool does (shown to the AI)
3. **Parameters Schema** - JSON Schema describing accepted parameters

Example:
```swift
Self.makePeekabooTool("menu", "Click menu bar items in applications")
```

The agent sees the full parameter schema:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "app": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Application name"
    },
    "item": {
      "type": "string", 
      "description": "Menu item to click (e.g., 'New Window')"
    },
    "path": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Menu path for nested items (e.g., 'File > New > Window')"
    }
  },
  "required": ["app"]
}
```

## Agent Instructions

The agent receives comprehensive instructions about all available tools:
- Tools are organized by category (Vision, UI Interaction, Application Control, Discovery)
- Each tool includes a brief description of its purpose
- Instructions guide the agent on when and how to use each tool

## Testing Results

Successfully tested:
- ✅ List command - Listed all running applications
- ✅ Menu command - Opened Finder menu and created new window
- ✅ Vision capabilities - Analyzed screenshots with GPT-4o
- ✅ Complex workflows - Combined multiple tools for automation

## Example Usage

```bash
# Use all tools for complex automation
./peekaboo agent "List all apps, launch Safari, navigate to the bookmarks menu, take a screenshot and describe what you see" --model gpt-4o
